# arg-gemini-3pro Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
High-quality, maintainable code is mandatory. All code must be clear, concise, and well-documented. Adherence to established coding standards and best practices is non-negotiable.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is required for all features. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability and correctness. Test-driven development (TDD) is strongly encouraged.

### III. Consistent User Experience
The user experience must be consistent and intuitive across the entire application. All UI components and user workflows should adhere to a unified design system and interaction patterns.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Applications must meet defined performance benchmarks. This includes, but is not limited to, response times, resource utilization, and scalability. Performance testing is a required step before any release.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and supersedes all other practices. All development activities, including code reviews and architectural decisions, must verify compliance with these principles.

Any proposed amendments to this Constitution require a formal review process, including documentation of the change, a clear justification, and an approved migration plan.
