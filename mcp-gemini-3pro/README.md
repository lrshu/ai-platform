This project is governed by a constitution that outlines our core development principles.

## Project Constitution

The constitution, located at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, defines the standards all contributions must follow. Adherence is mandatory and verified during code review.

### Core Principles

1.  **I. Code Quality**: All code MUST adhere to a consistent style, be well-documented, and follow established best practices.
2.  **II. Rigorous Testing Standards**: Every feature or bug fix MUST be accompanied by comprehensive automated tests.
3.  **III. User Experience Consistency**: All user-facing components and interactions MUST be consistent in design and behavior.
4.  **IV. Performance by Design**: Performance is a critical feature and MUST be considered from the outset of any development.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the full [constitution document](.specify/memory/constitution.md).
