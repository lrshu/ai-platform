# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story, following the RAG Backend Platform Constitution principles.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

For RAG backend implementations:
- **Source code**: `app/` at repository root (following constitution structure)
- **Tests**: `tests/` at repository root

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure following RAG backend constitution

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan (following app/ directory structure)
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python 3.12+ project with FastAPI, Pydantic V2 dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (uv support)
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup config.json5 with environment variable loading
